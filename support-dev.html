<h5 class="expand_heading">2. What tools do I need for installation?</h5>
<div class="toggle_container">
    <div class="box">
        <p>Across the Smart Lock and Keyless Entry lines, our locks are designed to replace your existing deadbolt using
            nothing but a #2 phillips screwdriver.</p>

<h5 class="expand_heading">3. Do I need to drill holes in my door?</h5>
<div class="toggle_container">
    <div class="box">
        <p>You are not required to, but you can choose to drill an upper hole if you want the lock to have added
            stability. Refer to the template included with purchase for instructions on how and where to drill
            this optional hole.</p>

<h5 class="expand_heading">4. What tools do I need to drill into my door?</h5>
<div class="toggle_container">
    <div class="box">
        <p>For doors where a mechanical deadbolt was already installed, and you are simply choosing to
            drill an additional hole for stability, you will need:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Power drill.</li>
            <li>3/8” (or 10mm) drill bit.</li>

<h5 class="expand_heading">5. Can I keep my existing deadbolt and install a Hugolog Smart Lock
    or Keyless entry?</h5>
<div class="toggle_container">
    <div class="box">
        <p>We do not recommend using a Hugolog product with your existing deadbolt as many
            deadbolts are not compatible with our products. Hugolog only guarantees
            functionality for components sold by our online store or other authorized dealers.
            Attempts to use components of our locks with non-Hugolog products may result in
            irreversible damage to your smart lock or keyless entry lock and will void your
            warranty.</p>

<h5 class="expand_heading">6. Can I change the backset of my deadbolt?</h5>
<div class="toggle_container">

<h5 class="expand_heading">8. Is my lock waterproof?</h5>
<div class="toggle_container">
    <div class="box">
        <p>Hugolog products feature IP54 weatherproof rating for the
            front panels of the locks. This protects the inner
            components of the lock from the ingress of some moisture and
            small particles. We do not recommend exposing the back panel
            to the outdoors where it can be drenched by precipitation or
            humidity. Exposure to liquids could cause your lock to
            short-circuit or malfunction.</p>

<h5>9. In what weather conditions can the lock function?</h5>
<div class="toggle_container">

        <p>Our products work in environments with temperatures
            ranging from -4°F to 129°F (-20°C to 55°C). To

    <div class="box">
        <p>If you want to control the lock remotely when you are travelling, at work or simply going to grocery store,
            you need to set up the lock to the Bluetooth hub to get the lock on to the internet. If you just want to use
            point-to-point Bluetooth via your mobile phone, then the hub is not mandatory.</p>

        <p>Download and install the Hugolog app. Register an account and log in. Within 5 minutes of resetting the lock,
            the lock will have Bluetooth pairing mode enabled. During this time, open the app on your phone and make
            sure your Bluetooth is on. The lock should automatically be discovered by the app and you can add it to the
            app by click on “Add Now”. Tap on that button and the app will set up the lock to be added to your account.
            You can now access your lock, when you are within Bluetooth range, with the app.</p>
